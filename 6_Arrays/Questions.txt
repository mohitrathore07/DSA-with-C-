📌 Tips:
Try to implement in dry-run form before writing code

Use Hash Maps, Prefix Sums, and Sliding Windows in some of these

Sure! Here's a list of ✅ Bonus Pattern-Based Array Questions — these are logical, high-value problems that follow specific solving patterns (like prefix sum, XOR tricks, sliding window, etc.). These types of problems often show up in coding rounds and interviews.

✅ Bonus: Pattern-Based Questions from Arrays
🔹 1. Count Subarrays with Even Sum / Odd Sum
→ Use prefix sum + modulo

🔹 2. Count Number of Subarrays with XOR = K
→ Use prefix XOR + unordered_map

🔹 3. Maximum Product Subarray
→ Track max and min product at each step (because of negatives)

🔹 4. Longest Subarray with Sum = K
→ Sliding window for positives, hashmap for mix of positives/negatives

🔹 5. Longest Subarray with Equal 0s and 1s
→ Replace 0s with -1s → use prefix sum + hashmap

🔹 6. Maximum Sum of i * arr[i] with Array Rotations
→ Use rotation formula:
 next_sum = curr_sum + total_sum - n * arr[n - i]

🔹 7. Rearrange Array so that arr[i] = i or -1
→ For index i, if i is present, place i at arr[i], else -1

🔹 8. Check if Array Can Be Sorted by At Most One Swap
→ Compare with sorted array, count mismatches

🔹 9. Smallest Missing Positive Number
→ Rearrangement-based: place number i at index i - 1

🔹 10. Find Two Non-Overlapping Subarrays with Given Sum
→ Use prefix sum + hash + window shrinking
